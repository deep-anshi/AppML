*Machine Learning and Deep Learning Assignments*

**Machine Learning Assignment 1**
Designing a Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression Classifier using the heart dataset here() Returned relevant metrics and proposed the best classifier.
For data, we have three datasets – heartval.csv, hearttrain.csv and hearttest.csv for validation, training and testing respectively.


**Machine Learning Assignment 2**
Part 1: Solved a clustering and classification task using the k-means algorithm and K-nearest neighbor classification respectively. Datasets for this problem was a synthetic two-dimensional dataset
Part 2: Implemented several classifiers like Decision tree, Random forest, SVM classifiers to predict whether a passenger from the titanic can survive based on their information. 


**Deep Learning Assignment 3**
Part 1: Multi-layer Feedforward Neural network for classification
Here I explored the data, trained and evaluated a feed-forward neural network model using chronic kidney disease dataset from Kaggle
Part 2: Unsupervised Deep learning for Data Representation
Applied t-SNE to visualize the PanCancer Dataset


**Deep Learning Assignment 4**
Part 1: Trained a Convolution Neural Network Model (CNN)
Trained Resnet18 model that can distinguish between cats and dogs images from scratch and via transferred learning (pre-trained Resnet18 on ImageNet)
Part 2: Trained a Long – Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM)
Used the Yelp dataset containing 500 positive and 500 negative reviews to design a neural network architecture to detect sentiments in text
